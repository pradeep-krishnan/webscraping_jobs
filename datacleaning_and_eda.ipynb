We accomplish this by leveraging machine learning to infer user attributes such as demographics and interests. Advertisers can then use these attributes to specify the type of person their advertisement should target. What you will do: The best way to understand a person’s interests is by understanding how they spend their time online. If we can understand the topics, concepts, and entities related to and referenced in the online content that people engage with on and off of Twitter, then we can understand a person’s interests in great detail.

       "21996  Every day, scientists around the world use Benchling in their efforts to solve humanity's most pressing problems. From developing innovative cancer treatments to engineering microbes that produce sustainable biofuels, our users rely on Benchling to plan, carry out, and document their research in a collaborative environment. Historically, scientists have tried to do the same things with scattered software, manual data entry, and lots of paper. As research has grown more complex, the shortfalls of those approaches have grown more apparent and more cumbersome. But in a field where innovation is the bottom line, no one should have to settle for the status quo. Benchling's integrated lab notebook, molecular biology suite, and workflow management tools unify and streamline experimental design, data analysis, and results gathering. As a result, scientists can spend less time on busy work and more time on science, so we can address the problems we face sooner. Benchling is building a world...   \n",
